# CDSLib

This personal project aims to implement several advanced data structures in C, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure is modularized for ease of use and reusability.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for data structures.
- `include/`: Header files defining structure types and function prototypes.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for each data structure.

## Building the Project

To compile the project, run:
```
make
```

To clean the build files run:
```
make clean
```

## Running tests

To run tests, compile the test files seperately, or include them in your main program.
